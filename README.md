# SpringMVC-based-Restfull-API-template

A basic CRUD operation with Restfull API template has been implemented here which is based on Spring Web MVC framework.

How to run:
1. Create a MySQL database named 'lms' where table name=departments, column=id(not null, Primary key, autoincrement), name(char).

2. Run this project from pom.xml

#This project is based on Java 8 & Tomcat 8.

Anyone can use this template to quickstart his SpringMVC based app. Enjoy :)
